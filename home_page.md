# Welcome to the Research Coding Community (RCC) Coding Club Template Guide

This is a **template website** for running a Research Coding Community (RCC) Coding Club.
It is intentionally minimal and fully customizable — replace text, images, and pages with your own.

- 📣 Use the **Community** pages to share how to join and participate.
- 🧑🏽‍🏫 Add **Courses** and workshops with notebooks and quizzes.
- 🚀 Deployed automatically to **GitHub Pages** via GitHub Actions.

> Tip: add your logo to `_static/logo.png` and set colors / theme in `_config.yml`.
